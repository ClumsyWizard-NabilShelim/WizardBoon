A game made in a week for the 3rd BTP game jam. The theme of the jam was: Less Is More. The game is a turn-based stratgy game where the more cards you have the less damage each cards will do.

Made using:
  - Unity Game Engine.
  - C# programming engine.
  - Bfxr for sound effects.
  - Aseprite for pixel art.
